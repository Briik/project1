# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets expectations**: I'd like to see you work on making your commit messages intentional -- that is, avoiding commit messages like "adding files", which isn't very descriptive. To make doing that less of a pain in the butt, it's really helpful to know how to undo a previous commit and re-do with some minor changes. I swear by `git reset --soft head~`.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets expectations**: Nicely done! You did a great job of incorporating event listeners, jQuery selectors and methods, and DOM manipulation. 

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**: I left comments in your code; check out my pull request. All-in-all, I was really pleased to see that you really worked on chunking your code into discreet methods. I get the impression that after a while you started "checking out" while coding and were just trying to get it done, hence having nonsemantic classes like "stuff". What you've created is totally something you could show off to employers, but before you do it may be a good idea to "semantic-ify" your code a bit more. Make sure you don't get into the habit of writing nonsemantic variable and function names. It sounds simple, but it's a surprisingly difficult habit to break.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets expectations**: I'm impressed with what you put together, Bryce, and hope you are too!
