Flashcards - National Capitals is a project by Bryce Lively as part of General Assembly's 7th Washington, DC Web Developemnt Immersive program.  

URL: http://briik.github.io/project1/

Techologies used include HTML, jQuery, and CSS3. This project uses open-source otf fonts to provide a persistent user experience.  jQuery DOM manipulation and HTML forms are used to add user-generated content to the page and incorporate that content into the existing functionality. CSS manipulation is used to provide a consistent game environment.  Pop up windows are reserved for providing feedback to the user's inputs.

I would have liked to completely replace the prompt used to get feedback from the user.

User Stories:

As a user, I should be able to select a card from the screen so that I choose which card I am testing myself on, thusly not getting frustrated with the site for throwing the same card at me repeatedly.
As a user, I should be quizzed on my knowledge of the subject.
As a user, I shoudl be shown the corrct responce after I am quizzed, to reinforce that knowledge.
As a user, I should be informed whether my response to the quiz was correct or not.
As a user, I should be able to add cards to the 'deck', as needed.
As a user, when I add cards to the deck, they should be placed at the top of the deck/gamespace.
